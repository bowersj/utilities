# utilities
This is generic repository for common functions I need often.

The folder structure is as follows

root
  enviroment (i.e. node)
    dictory containing modules/libraries
      README.md laying out the use cases for each directories contents
      file containing the code.
      
So since node is my current focus here is that layout (as of 12/11/2018)

root
  node
    fibonacciSequence
      fibonacci-loop
        README.md - explanation of fibonacci-loop.js
        fibonacci-loop.js - code
    walkFileSystem
      README.md - explanation of walk.js
      walk.js
