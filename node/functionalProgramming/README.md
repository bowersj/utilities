# Functional Programming
The purpose of this section is to provide basic, 
and classic, functional programming functions. 

### Why not a standard library
standard libraries are great! They give away tones
of helpful and powerful functions for free, so why
not use them. Simple, they are too big. Now many
people have tried, and many succeed, in making smaller
more modular versions but the point remains, I really
only need one functions to make my life easier when 
it comes to functional programming, two if you
count pipe, compose.
