# Data Structures in Pure JavaScript

These data structures are using the factory function approach to be compatible with older and newer browsers

With that caviot out of the way, I would like to point out that these data structures are taken from a [course](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)
on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) they are not perfect by any means but are a good starting point and could
use significant enhancement. Anyone who wants to enhance these classes and data structures can do so as
long they are in compliance with the license agreement found in the LICENSE file at the root of the repository.
I would love to see your enhancements as well and, with your permission, would love to add them to this collection
of useful code. So please post your enhancements in the issues and mark it as a feature request.
