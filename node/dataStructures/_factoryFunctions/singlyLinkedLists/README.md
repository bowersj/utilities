# Singly Linked List

A Singly Linked List is a list that only contains references to the next item in that list.

Below is a list of the methods associated with the SinglyLinkedList class.

* __[pop](https://github.com/bowersj/utilities/blob/29b083c9f4508e2666c9fa13aa3a0865d0bc9c3e/node/dataStructures/singlyLinkedLists/singlyLinkedLists.js#L37)__     - Get the last item in the list.

* __[unshift](https://github.com/bowersj/utilities/blob/29b083c9f4508e2666c9fa13aa3a0865d0bc9c3e/node/dataStructures/singlyLinkedLists/singlyLinkedLists.js#L69)__ - Sets the first item in the list to the provided value.
