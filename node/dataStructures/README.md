# Data Structures in Pure JavaScript

These data strucutes are using ES6 features and thus require a modern browser to run them.

With that caviot out of the way, I would like to point out that these data structures are taken from a [course](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)
on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) they are not perfect by anymeans but are a good starting point and could
use significant enhancement. Anyone who wants to enhance these classes and data structures can do so as
long they are in complience with the license agreement found in the LICENSE file at the root of the repository.
I would love to see your enhancements as well and, with your permission, would love to add them to this collection
of useful code. So please post your enhancements in the issues and mark it as a feature request.

Here is a list of the current data structures

* [Singly Linked Lists](https://github.com/bowersj/utilities/blob/master/node/dataStructures/singlyLinkedLists)
* [Doubly Linked Lists](https://github.com/bowersj/utilities/blob/master/node/dataStructures/doublyLinkedLists)
* [Stacks](https://github.com/bowersj/utilities/blob/master/node/dataStructures/stack)
* [Queues](https://github.com/bowersj/utilities/blob/master/node/dataStructures/queue)
* [Binary Search Trees](https://github.com/bowersj/utilities/blob/master/node/dataStructures/binarySearchTree)
* [Priority Queues](https://github.com/bowersj/utilities/blob/master/node/dataStructures/priorityQueue)
* [Binary Heaps](https://github.com/bowersj/utilities/tree/master/node/dataStructures/binaryHeaps)

I am planning on adding the following, when I can find the time...

* Trees
* Graphs

As always please post any feedback in the issues area and label it accordingly.

Happy Coding!!
