# Binary Search Tree

This directory contains two types of files, a version to 
run in `node.js` and a pure javascript version. If you 
want to run a BST in the browser go with the Pure 
JavaScript version. If you want to run this in `node.js`
then run the bst_object.js version. 

The reason for the naming is that I am working on an 
implementation that uses an array instead of objects. 
Why? mostly for demonstration purposes but if you want
to use that it will be added under the file name
`bst_array.js`.

If you have any comments please add them to the issues
area with the flag comment.

Enjoy!
